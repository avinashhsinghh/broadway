# broadway Project
**Website for a Fictional Web Design Company**  
In this project, I created a web site for broadway, a fictional web design agency. Besides jQuery, I used [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
and [aos.css](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) to enhance the look of the website and improve user experience.
